⚙️ How it Works:
React frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 or 3001

Backend API runs at http://localhost:5000

React fetches data via Axios from backend

MongoDB stores all users, products, orders

🪲 Debugging Done:
Solved Network Error (CORS & wrong URLs)

Fixed missing component files (Home.jsx, etc.)

Corrected Axios base URL

Enabled backend CORS policy

Ensured MongoDB connected via Compass/local

Verified all routes with Postman

Resolved build and ESLint warnings

📸 UI Pages Developed:
✅ Landing Page with Categories

✅ Product Grid View

✅ Login/Register Forms

✅ Cart & Profile

✅ Admin Dashboard

✅ New Product Form

✅ Order History

📝 Conclusion:
The ShopEZ project is now a fully functional e-commerce platform with:

Complete user flow from browsing → cart → order

Admin-side management features

Modular code structure for maintainability

✅ Successfully built and debugged
✅ Ready for deployment on platforms like Render, Vercel, or Netlify + MongoDB Atlas
